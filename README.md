# üöÄ SmartFusion RAG  
**Hybrid AI Question Answering System for PDFs & Web Content**

SmartFusion RAG is an AI-powered document question-answering system developed as part of a Master's Thesis in Applied Computer Science. It enables users to ask natural language questions across large-scale **PDF documents** and **HTML webpages**, combining **semantic vector search** with **SQL-based metadata filtering** for precise and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

## üß† Thesis Objective

The goal is to explore how to combine traditional metadata filtering (e.g., country, job area, source type) with modern embedding-based retrieval to create a robust and flexible question-answering system that works across unstructured document formats.

---

## üéØ Research Questions

1. How can document metadata be stored and used effectively for filtered retrieval in a Hybrid RAG system?  
2. What is the best way to combine SQL-based metadata filtering with embedding-based document search?  
3. How can large-scale text data (PDFs & HTML) be efficiently processed and stored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation?  
4. How can follow-up questions improve user interaction in a multi-document RAG system?  
5. *(Optional)* How does the inclusion of HTML pages and speech-to-text inputs affect performance and usability?
